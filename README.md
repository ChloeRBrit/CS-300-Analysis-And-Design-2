# CS-300-Analysis-And-Design-2
So, in our course project, we were tackling the task of building a course planner app. The main idea was to create something that could handle course data, let users see a list of courses, and give them detailed info about each course, including prerequisites. To crack this nut, we had to get cozy with data structures. We explored options like vectors, hashtables, and trees to stash all that course data in an organized way. Understanding which structure suited our needs best was key. Then came the fun part: diving into coding! We faced hurdles like dealing with file handling, parsing data, and making searches speedy. But hey, that's where debugging skills and team support kicked in.

Working on this project totally revamped our approach to writing code. We got serious about keeping our programs tidy, readable, and easy to maintain. Breaking things down into smaller, reusable chunks became our mantra. Plus, we picked up habits like commenting our code well and sticking to coding conventions. It was all about making our programs not just work, but work well and stay flexible for future tweaks. And you know what? It was a journey full of learning and growth that's sure to pay off in our future coding adventures!
