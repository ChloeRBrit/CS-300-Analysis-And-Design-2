# CS-300-Analysis-And-Design-2
The runtime analysis provides a breakdown of the time complexities for each operation involved in the program, considering different data structures. For instance, when using the Vector data structure for printing course information, the total cost is calculated by summing up the costs of each operation, resulting in a linear runtime complexity of O(n), where n is the number of courses. Similarly, analyses are provided for Hashtable and Tree data structures.

Regarding the recommendation, it suggests employing a Hashtable data structure due to its favorable characteristics. Hashtables offer fast lookup and insertion times, making them well-suited for handling extensive datasets efficiently. They also provide a balance between memory utilization and performance, addressing potential concerns such as collisions and rehashing overhead. Overall, a Hashtable is recommended for this task as it offers optimal performance for managing course data and fulfilling the program requirements.
